# TouchMeNot
“TOUCH ME NOT” is a real time gesture recognition tool which can detect and count number of raised fingers.

This tool can be used to create a touchless interface with any computer system with a camera capability and a screen. We have created a touchless feedback system for a restaurant as one of the applications for this system
